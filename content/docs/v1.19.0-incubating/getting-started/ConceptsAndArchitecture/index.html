<h2 id="producers-consumers-topics-and-subscriptions">Producers, consumers, topics, and subscriptions</h2>

<p>Pulsar is built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> pattern, aka <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is the publish-subscribe pattern (pub-sub)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A messaging pattern in which publisher proccesses publish messages on topics that are then consumed (processed) by consumer processes." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">pub-sub</span>. In this pattern, <a href="#producers">producers</a> publish messages to <a href="#topics">topics</a>. <a href="#consumers">Consumers</a> can then <a href="#subscription-modes">subscribe</a> to those topics, process incoming messages, and send an <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledgement</span> when processing is complete.</p>

<p>Once a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a subscription?" data-placement="top" data-content="A lease on a topic established by a consumer. Pulsar has three subscription modes (exclusive, shared, and failover)." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">subscription</span> has been created, all messages will be <a href="#persistent-storage">retained</a> by Pulsar, even if the consumer gets disconnected. Retained messages will be discarded only when a consumer <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledges</span> that they’ve been successfully processed.</p>

<h3 id="producers">Producers</h3>

<p>A producer is a process that attaches to a topic and publishes messages to a Pulsar <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span> for processing.</p>

<h4 id="send-modes">Send modes</h4>

<p>Producers can send messages to brokers either synchronously (sync) or asynchronously (async).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Mode</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Sync send</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The producer will wait for acknowledgement from the broker after sending each message. If acknowledgment isn’t received then the producer will consider the send operation a failure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Async send</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The producer will put the message in a blocking queue and return immediately. The client library will then send the message to the broker in the background. If the queue is full (max size <a href="../../reference/Configuration#broker">configurable</a>, the producer could be blocked or fail immediately when calling the API, depending on arguments passed to the producer.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="compression">Compression</h4>

<p>Messages published by producers can be compressed during transportation in order to save bandwidth. Pulsar currently supports two types of compression:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lz4/lz4">LZ4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://zlib.net/">ZLIB</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="batching">Batching</h4>

<p>If batching is enabled, the producer will accumulate and send a batch of messages in a single request. Batching size is defined by the maximum number of messages and maximum publish latency.</p>

<h3 id="consumers">Consumers</h3>

<p>A consumer is a process that attaches to a topic via a subscription and then receives messages.</p>

<h4 id="receive-modes">Receive modes</h4>

<p>Messages can be received from <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">brokers</span> either synchronously (sync) or asynchronously (async).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Mode</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Sync receive</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">A sync receive will be blocked until a message is available.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Async receive</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">An async receive will return immediately with a future value—a <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture"><code class="highlighter-rouge">CompletableFuture</code></a> in Java, for example—that completes once a new message is available.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h4>

<p>When a consumer has successfully processed a message, it needs to send an <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledgement</span> to the broker so that the broker can discard the message (otherwise it <a href="#persistent-storage">stores</a> the message).</p>

<p>Messages can be acknowledged either one by one or cumulatively. With cumulative acknowledgement, the consumer only needs to acknowledge the last message it received. All messages in the stream up to (and including) the provided message will not be re-delivered to that consumer.</p>

In this interface, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">received</code> method is called whenever a new message is received.</p>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<p>As in other pub-sub systems, topics in Pulsar are named channels for transmitting messages from producers to consumers. Topic names are URLs that have a well-defined structure:</p>

<h3 id="subscription-modes">Subscription modes</h3>

<p>A subscription is a named configuration rule that determines how messages are delivered to <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumers</span>. There are three available subscription modes in Pulsar: <a href="#exclusive">exclusive</a>, <a href="#shared">shared</a>, and <a href="#failover">failover</a>. These modes are illustrated in the figure below.</p>

<p><img src="/img/pulsar_subscriptions.jpg" alt="Subscription Modes" /></p>

<h4 id="exclusive">Exclusive</h4>

<p>In <em>exclusive</em> mode, only a single consumer is allowed to attach to the subscription. If more than one consumer attempts to subscribe to a topic using the same subscription, the consumer receives an error.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, only <strong>Consumer-A</strong> is allowed to consume messages.</p>

<p>Exclusive mode is the default subscription mode.</p>

<h4 id="shared">Shared</h4>

<p>In <em>shared</em> or <em>round robin</em> mode, multiple consumers can attach to the same subscription. Messages are delivered in a round robin distribution across consumers, and any given message is delivered to only one consumer. When a consumer disconnects, all the messages that were sent to it and not acknowledged will be rescheduled for sending to the remaining consumers.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, <strong>Consumer-B-1</strong> and <strong>Consumer-B-2</strong> are able to subscribe to the topic, but <strong>Consumer-C-1</strong> and others could as well.</p>

<div class="admonition">
  <div class="warning">
    <span class="admonition-title"><p>Limitations of shared mode</p>
</span>
    <p>There are two important things to be aware of when using shared mode:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h4 id="failover">Failover</h4>

<p>In <em>failover</em> mode, multiple consumers can attach to the same subscription. The consumers will be lexically sorted by the consumer’s name and the first consumer will initially be the only one receiving messages. This consumer is called the <em>master consumer</em>.</p>

<p>When the master consumer disconnects, all (non-acked and subsequent) messages will be delivered to the next consumer in line.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, Consumer-C-1 is the master consumer while Consumer-C-2 would be the next in line to receive messages if Consumer-C-2 disconnected.</p>

<h3 id="partitioned-topics">Partitioned topics</h3>

<p>Normal topics can be served only by a single <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span>, which limits the topic’s maximum throughput. <em>Partitioned topics</em> are a special type of topic that be handled by multiple brokers, which allows for much higher throughput.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, a partitioned topic is actually implemented as N internal topics, where N is the number of partitions. When publishing messages to a partitioned topic, each message is routed to one of several brokers. The distribution of partitions across brokers is handled automatically by Pulsar.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/pulsar_partitioned_topic.jpg" alt="Partitioned Topic" /></p>

<p>Here, the topic <strong>T1</strong> has five partitions (<strong>P0</strong> through <strong>P4</strong>) split across three brokers. Because there are more partitions than brokers, two brokers handle two partitions a piece, while the third handles only one (again, Pulsar handles this distribution of partitions automatically).</p>

<p>Messages for this topic are broadcast to two <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumers</span>. The <a href="#routing-modes">routing mode</a> determines both which broker handles each partition, while the <a href="../../getting-started/ConceptsAndArchitecture#subscription-modes">subscription mode</a> determines which messages go to which consumers.</p>

<p>Decisions about routing and subscription modes can be made separately in most cases. Throughput concerns should guide partitioning/routing decisions while subscription decisions should be guided by application semantics.</p>

<p>There is no difference between partitioned topics and normal topics in terms of how subscription modes work, as partitioning only determines what happens between when a message is published by a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a producer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that publishes messages to a Pulsar topic." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">producer</span> and processed and <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledged</span> by a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumer</span>.</p>

<p>Partitioned topics need to be explicitly created via the <a href="../../admin/AdminInterface">admin API</a>. The number of partitions can be specified when creating the topic.</p>

<h4 id="routing-modes">Routing modes</h4>

<p>When publishing to partitioned topics, you must specify a <em>routing mode</em>. The routing mode determines which partition—that is, which internal topic—each message should be published to.</p>

<p>There are three routing modes available by default:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Mode</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Description</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Ordering guarantee</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Key hash</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">If a key property has been specified on the message, the partitioned producer will hash the key and assign it to a particular partition.</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Per-key-bucket ordering</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Single default partition</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">If no key is provided, each producer’s message will be routed to a dedicated partition, initially random selected</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Per-producer ordering</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Round robin distribution</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">If no key is provided, all messages will be routed to different partitions in round-robin fashion to achieve maximum throughput.</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">None</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In addition to these default modes, you can also create a custom routing mode if you’re using the <a href="../../clients/Java">Java client</a> by implementing the <a target="_blank" href="/api/client/com/yahoo/pulsar/client/api/MessageRouter.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageRouter</code></a> interface.</p>

<div class="admonition">
  <div class="success">
    <span class="admonition-title"><p>Notice</p>
</span>
    
<p>This feature is still in experimental mode and implementation details may change in future release.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>As name suggests, non-persist topic does not persist messages into any durable storage disk unlike persistent topic where messages are durably persisted on multiple disks.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you are using persistent delivery, messages are persisted to disk/database so that they will survive a broker restart or subscriber failover. While using non-persistent delivery, if you kill a broker or subscriber is disconnected then subscriber will lose all in-transit messages. So, client may see message loss with non-persistent topic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In non-persistent topic, as soon as broker receives published message, it immediately delivers this message to all connected subscribers without persisting them into any storage. So, if subscriber gets disconnected with broker then broker will not be able to deliver those in-transit messages and subscribers will never be able to receive those messages again. Broker also drops a message for the consumer, if consumer does not have enough permit to consume message, or consumer TCP channel is not writable. Therefore, consumer receiver queue size (to accommodate enough permits) and TCP-receiver window size (to keep channel writable) should be configured properly to avoid message drop for that consumer.</li>
  <li>Broker only allows configured number of in-flight messages per client connection. So, if producer tries to publish messages higher than this rate, then broker silently drops those new incoming messages without processing and delivering them to the subscribers. However, broker acknowledges with special message-id (<code class="highlighter-rouge">msg-id: -1:-1</code>) for those dropped messages to signal producer about the message drop.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Non-persistent messaging is usually faster than persistent messaging because broker does not persist messages and immediately sends ack back to producer as soon as that message deliver to all connected subscribers. Therefore, producer sees comparatively low publish latency with non-persistent topic.</p>

<h2 id="client-api">Client API</h2>

<p>A topic name will look like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>non-persistent://my-property/us-west/my-namespace/my-topic
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Producer and consumer can connect to non-persistent topic in a similar way, as persistent topic except topic name must start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">non-persistent</code>.</p>

<p>Non-persistent topic supports all 3 different subscription-modes: <strong>Exclusive</strong>, <strong>Shared</strong>, <strong>Failover</strong> which are already explained in details at <a href="../../getting-started/ConceptsAndArchitecture.md">GettingStarted</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/broker-bookie.png" alt="Brokers and bookies" /></p>

<p>Pulsar provides guaranteed message delivery for applications. If a message successfully reaches a Pulsar <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span>, it will be delivered to its intended target.</p>

<p>This guarantee requires that non-<span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledged</span> messages are stored in a durable manner until they can be delivered to and acknowledged by <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumers</span>. This mode of messaging is commonly called <em>persistent messaging</em>. In Pulsar, N copies of all messages are stored and synced on disk, for example 4 copies across two servers with mirrored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID</a> volumes on each server.</p>

<p>Pulsar uses a system called <a href="http://bookkeeper.apache.org/">Apache BookKeeper</a> for persistent message storage. BookKeeper is a distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging">write-ahead log</a> (WAL) system that provides a number of crucial advantages for Pulsar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It enables Pulsar to utilize many independent logs, called <a href="#ledgers">ledgers</a>. Multiple ledgers can be created for <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a topic?" data-placement="top" data-content="A named channel used to pass messages published by producers to consumers who process those messages." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">topics</span> over time.</li>
  <li>It offers very efficient storage for sequential data that handles entry replication.</li>
  <li>It guarantees read consistency of ledgers in the presence of various system failures.</li>
  <li>It offers even distribution of I/O across bookies.</li>
  <li>It’s horizontally scalable in both capacity and throughput. Capacity can be immediately increased by adding more <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a bookie?" data-placement="top" data-content="Bookie is just a nickname for an individual BookKeeper server." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">bookies</span> to a cluster.</li>
  <li><span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a bookie?" data-placement="top" data-content="Bookie is just a nickname for an individual BookKeeper server." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">Bookies</span> are designed to handle thousands of ledgers with concurrent reads and writes. By using multiple disk devices—one for journal and another for general storage–bookies are able to isolate the effects of read operations from the latency of ongoing write operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to message data, <em>cursors</em> are also persistently stored in BookKeeper. Cursors are <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a subscription?" data-placement="top" data-content="A lease on a topic established by a consumer. Pulsar has three subscription modes (exclusive, shared, and failover)." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">subscription</span> positions for <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumers</span>. BookKeeper enables Pulsar to store consumer position in a scalable fashion.</p>

<p>At the moment, Pulsar only supports persistent message storage. This accounts for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">persistent</code> in all <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a topic?" data-placement="top" data-content="A named channel used to pass messages published by producers to consumers who process those messages." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">topic</span> names. Here’s an example:</p>

<p>In the future, Pulsar will support ephemeral message storage.</p>

<h3 id="ledgers">Ledgers</h3>

<p>A <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a ledger?" data-placement="top" data-content="An append-only data structure in BookKeeper that is used to persistently store messages in Pulsar topics." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">ledger</span> is an append-only data structure with a single writer that is assigned to multiple BookKeeper storage nodes, or <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a bookie?" data-placement="top" data-content="Bookie is just a nickname for an individual BookKeeper server." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">bookies</span>. Ledger entries are replicated to multiple bookies. Ledgers themselves have very simple semantics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Pulsar broker can create a ledger, append entries to the ledger, and close the ledger.</li>
  <li>After the ledger has been closed—either explicitly or because the writer process crashed—it can then be opened only in read-only mode.</li>
  <li>Finally, when entries in the ledger are no longer needed, the whole ledger can be deleted from the system (across all bookies).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ledger-read-consistency">Ledger read consistency</h4>

<p>The main strength of Bookkeeper is that it guarantees read consistency in ledgers in the presence of failures. Since the ledger can only be written to by a single process, that process is free to append entries very efficiently, without need to obtain consensus. After a failure, the ledger will go through a recovery process that will finalize the state of the ledger and establish which entry was last committed to the log. After that point, all readers of the ledger are guaranteed to see the exact same content.</p>

<h4 id="managed-ledgers">Managed ledgers</h4>

<p>Given that Bookkeeper ledgers provide a single log abstraction, a library was developed on top of the ledger called the <em>managed ledger</em> that represents the storage layer for a single topic. A managed ledger represents the abstraction of a stream of messages with a single writer that keeps appending at the end of the stream and multiple <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cursor?" data-placement="top" data-content="The subscription position for a consumer." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">cursors</span> that are consuming the stream, each with its own associated position.</p>

<p>Internally, a single managed ledger uses multiple BookKeeper ledgers to store the data. There are two reasons to have multiple ledgers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>After a failure, a ledger is no longer writable and a new one needs to be created.</li>
  <li>A ledger can be deleted when all cursors have consumed the messages it contains. This allows for periodic rollover of ledgers.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="journal-storage">Journal storage</h3>

<p>In BookKeeper, <em>journal</em> files contain BookKeeper transaction logs. Before making an update to a <a href="#ledgers">ledger</a>, a bookie needs to ensure that a transaction describing the update is written to persistent (non-volatile) storage. A new journal file is created once the bookie starts or the older journal file reaches the journal file size threshold (configured using the <a href="../../reference/Configuration#bookkeeper-journalMaxSizeMB"><code class="highlighter-rouge">journalMaxSizeMB</code></a> parameter).</p>

<h3 id="non-persistent-storage">Non-persistent storage</h3>

<p>A future version of BookKeeper will support <em>non-persistent messaging</em> and thus multiple durability modes at the topic level. This will enable you to set the durability mode at the topic level, replacing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">persistent</code> in topic names with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">non-persistent</code> indicator.</p>

<h2 id="replication">Replication</h2>

<p>Pulsar enables messages to be produced and consumed in different geo-locations. For instance, your application may be publishing data in one region or market and you would like to process it for consumption in other regions or markets. <a href="../../admin/GeoReplication">Geo-replication</a> in Pulsar enables you to do that.</p>

<h2 id="multi-tenancy">Multi-tenancy</h2>

<p>Pulsar was created from the ground up as a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is multi-tenancy?" data-placement="top" data-content="The ability to isolate namespaces, specify quotas, and configure authentication and authorization on a per-property basis." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">multi-tenant</span> system. To support multi-tenancy, Pulsar has a concept of <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a property?" data-placement="top" data-content="A Pulsar tenant." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">properties</span>. Properties can be spread across <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cluster?" data-placement="top" data-content="A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies). Clusters can reside in different geographical regions and replicate messages to one another in a process called geo-replication." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">clusters</span> and can each have their own <a href="../../admin/Authz">authentication and authorization</a> scheme applied to them. They are also the administrative unit at which <a href="TODO">storage quotas</a>, <a href="TODO">message TTL</a>, and <a href="TODO">isolation policies</a> can be managed.</p>

<p>The multi-tenant nature of Pulsar is reflected mostly visibly in topic URLs, which have this structure:</p>

<p>As you can see, the property is the most basic unit of categorization for topics (and even more fundamental than the <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cluster?" data-placement="top" data-content="A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies).

<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and Authorization</h2>

<p>Pulsar supports a pluggable <a href="../../admin/Authz">authentication</a> mechanism which can be configured at broker and it also supports authorization to identify client and its access rights on topics and properties.</p>

<h2 id="client-interface">Client interface</h2>

<p>Pulsar exposes a client API with language bindings for <a href="../../clients/Java">Java</a> and <a href="../../clients/Cpp">C++</a>. The client API optimizes and encapsulates Pulsar’s client-broker communication protocol and exposes a simple and intuitive API for use by applications.</p>

<p>Under the hood, the current official Pulsar client libraries support transparent reconnection and/or connection failover to <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers.

<p>If you’d like to create your own client library, we recommend consulting the documentation on Pulsar’s custom <a href="../../project/BinaryProtocol">binary protocol</a>.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="client-setup-phase">Client setup phase</h3>

<p>When an application wants to create a producer/consumer, the Pulsar client library will initiate a setup phase that is composed of two steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The client will attempt to determine the owner of the topic by sending an HTTP lookup request to the <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span>. The request could reach one of the active brokers which, by looking at the (cached) zookeeper metadata will know who is serving the topic or, in case nobody is serving it, will try to assign it to the least loaded broker.</li>
  <li>Once the client library has the broker address, it will create a TCP connection (or reuse an existing connection from the pool) and authenticate it. Within this connection, client and broker exchange binary commands from a custom protocol. At this point the client will send a command to create producer/consumer to the broker, which will comply after having validated the authorization policy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whenever the TCP connection breaks, the client will immediately re-initiate this setup phase and will keep trying with exponential backoff to re-establish the producer or consumer until the operation succeeds.</p>

<p>You can use your own service discovery system if you’d like. If you use your own system, there is just one requirement: when a client performs an HTTP request to an endpoint, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://pulsar.us-west.example.com:8080</code>, the client needs to be redirected to <em>some</em> active broker in the desired <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cluster?" data-placement="top" data-content="A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies).
